# Exasol Virtual Schema Common (Lua) 1.0.1, released 2023-04-28

Code name: Fixed Luarocks package contents

## Summary

This is a bugfix release where fixed the contents of the produced Luarocks package. For example the missing class `ExasolBaseAdapterProperties`.

Side note:

There are no changes to the sources compared to 1.0.0, the reason for this being that 1.0.0 was simply released from the wrong branch and thus not up-to-date. 

## Refactoring

* #7: Fixed Luarocks package contents
